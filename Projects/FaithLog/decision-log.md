# FaithLog Decision Log

This file records user-approved project decisions so Codex does not rely on guesses later.

## Rules

- Every product, architecture, data, deployment, test-strategy, or resume-metric decision must come from the user.
- If Codex is unsure, Codex must ask before implementation.
- Record the decision date, context, options if relevant, the user's decision, and the implementation impact.

## Decisions

### 2026-06-16 - User Owns All Project Decisions

- Context: The user stated that Codex must not develop or implement based on guesses.
- Decision: All ambiguous or unusual decisions must be asked of the user before implementation.
- Impact: Codex must stop and ask before choosing product behavior, architecture, schema, deployment, test strategy, monitoring scope, resume metrics, or implementation tradeoffs.

### 2026-06-16 - Track Resume Metrics During Development

- Context: The project will be deployed and operated, and the user wants resume-ready quantitative evidence.
- Decision: Codex should record measurable project progress, tests, troubleshooting, and improvements in Markdown and Obsidian.
- Impact: Metrics are tracked in `docs/resume-metrics.md` and mirrored to the Obsidian FaithLog note.

### 2026-06-16 - Backend API And Issue Policy Alignment

- Context: The user provided final backend policy decisions for auth, FCM, poll comments, devotion APIs, coffee charge automation, issue status management, and MVP exclusions.
- Decision: GitHub Issues must follow the final policies recorded in `docs/backend-implementation-policy.md`.
- Impact: Issues #21, #27, #28, #31, #38, #39, and #40 were updated with final policy details. Manual `칸반 상태:` lines were removed from #17~#41 where present so GitHub Project Board Status remains the source of truth.

## Pending Decisions

### 2026-06-16 - Poll Comment Issue Split

- Context: Poll comments are now MVP scope. Issue #38 contains the PollComment implementation scope.
- Pending question: Should PollComment stay inside #38, or should a separate `[Feat] 투표 댓글 구현` issue be created?
- Current action: No new issue was created because the user said to create it only if needed, and #38 now contains the required implementation scope.

### 2026-06-16 - Project Board Domain Fields For Mixed Domains

- Context: Project Board items #23 and #24 have mixed domain text in their issue bodies, but the board Domain field is single-select.
- Pending question: Should #23 use `global` or another convention for `global/domain-admin`, and should #24 use `global` or `notification` for `global/notification`?
- Current action: Domain was left blank for #23 and #24 to avoid guessing.
